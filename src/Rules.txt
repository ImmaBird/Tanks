Max Players: 8

1. To play, start a server and then give your opponents the IP address and port that shows up in the Server window if you're playing locally.
	-----If playing remotely, please look up how to port forward and give your client's your public IP.
2. For clients, put that IP address and port in the settings menu, put your name in, pick a tank and then hit start game.
	-----Note: No two players on the same server can have the same name.
3. When everyone is ready, the server host can hit Start Game to start up a new game. (Note: no one else can join once a game has started)
4. Shoot using either space bar or left click, and move using WASD.
5. If you lose all of your hearts, you die/lose.
6. Whoever survives at the end wins.
7. To play again, the server host can restart (which allows for new people to join) and then start a new game.
