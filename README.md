# Tanks
A 2D Tanks combat based game made in JavaFX.</br>
Made Sophomore year 1st Semester for a Network Programming class.</br>
</br>
## Cool Features
<ul>
<li>Networked, play with friends anywhere. (Works best over lan due to latency)</li>
<li>We created our own collision engine because JavaFX's built in methods didn't work how we wanted them to</li>
<li>All custom made tank images, including a few easter eggs</li>
<li>Server host sees all of their IP Addresses that client's can connect to</li>
</ul>
