## Cool Features
* Networked, play with friends anywhere. (Works best over lan due to latency)
* We created our own collision engine because JavaFX's built in methods didn't work how we wanted them to
* All custom made tank images, including a few easter eggs
* Server host sees all of their IP Addresses that client's can connect to
